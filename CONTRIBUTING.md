Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**! :)

If you have an idea or found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/douglaswp/WP-Tweaks/issues/new) on github.

If you want to contribute code, there a few rules to follow: 

- I am not going to nit-pick on all the details about the code style but indentation is a must. The important part is that code is readable.

- If you add a feature it should be documented.

- Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, please write a description
  which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

Thank you very much!
